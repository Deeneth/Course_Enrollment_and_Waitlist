### 4. Enrollment & Waitlist Demo (5-7 minutes)
**This is the core feature - spend most time here**

#### Initial Setup
**URL**: `http://localhost:8080/enrollments/add`

**Demo Scenario**:
Create a course with capacity 3, enroll 5 students to demonstrate waitlist.

**Steps**:

1. **First Enrollment** (Should be ENROLLED)
   - Select Student 1
   - Select your demo course
   - Submit
   - Show status: "ENROLLED"

2. **Second Enrollment** (Should be ENROLLED)
   - Select Student 2
   - Same course
   - Show status: "ENROLLED"

3. **Third Enrollment** (Should be ENROLLED)
   - Select Student 3
   - Same course
   - Show status: "ENROLLED"
   - **Explain**: Course now at full capacity (3/3)

4. **Fourth Enrollment** (Should be WAITLISTED)
   - Select Student 4
   - Same course
   - Show status: "WAITLISTED"
   - **Explain**: Automatic waitlist when full

5. **Fifth Enrollment** (Should be WAITLISTED)
   - Select Student 5
   - Same course
   - Show status: "WAITLISTED"

#### View Waitlist
**URL**: `http://localhost:8080/enrollments/waitlist/{courseId}`

1. Click "View Waitlist" button
2. Show 2 students waitlisted
3. **Explain**: FIFO order (First In, First Out)

#### Demonstrate Auto-Promotion
**This is the impressive part!**

1. Go to enrollments list
2. Delete one ENROLLED student
3. Immediately refresh or go back to enrollments
4. **Show**: First waitlisted student automatically promoted to ENROLLED
5. **Explain**:
   - System detected spot available
   - Automatically promoted from waitlist
   - No manual intervention needed

---

### 5. REST API Demo (3-4 minutes)
**Use Postman or curl**

#### Get All Students
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/students
```
Show JSON response

#### Enroll via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/enrollments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"studentId": 6, "courseId": 1}'
```

#### Check Waitlist via API
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/enrollments/waitlist/course/1
```

**Explain**: Full REST API for integration with other systems

## Key Points to Emphasize

### Technical Implementation
1. **Spring Boot 3.5.7** - Latest stable version
2. **Spring Data JPA** - Easy database operations
3. **Hibernate** - Automatic table creation
4. **Lombok** - Reduced boilerplate code
5. **Thymeleaf** - Server-side templates
6. **Bootstrap 5** - Modern, responsive UI

### Business Logic
1. **Capacity Management**
   - Real-time capacity checking
   - Prevents over-enrollment
   - Maintains data integrity

2. **Automatic Waitlist**
   - No manual intervention
   - Smart status assignment
   - FIFO ordering

3. **Auto-Promotion**
   - Triggered on enrollment deletion
   - Automatic status update
   - Maintains fairness

### Database Design
1. **Three main entities**: Students, Courses, Enrollments
2. **Proper relationships**: One-to-Many, Many-to-Many through junction table
3. **Constraints**: Email uniqueness, not-null fields
4. **Timestamps**: Join date, created date, enrolled date

### Code Quality
1. **Layered Architecture**
   - Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository â†’ Model
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy to maintain and extend

2. **RESTful API**
   - Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Appropriate status codes
   - JSON request/response

3. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks
   - Meaningful error messages
   - User-friendly alerts

## Questions to Anticipate

### Q1: How does the waitlist work?
**A**: When enrolling, the system counts current "ENROLLED" students. If count >= maxCapacity, new enrollment gets "WAITLISTED" status. When an enrolled student drops, system automatically promotes first waitlisted student.

### Q2: What happens if I increase course capacity?
**A**: You can manually change status from WAITLISTED to ENROLLED for waiting students, or delete and re-enroll them to trigger auto-status assignment.

### Q3: Can a student enroll in multiple courses?
**A**: Yes! A student can enroll in any number of courses. The system only checks duplicate enrollment in the same course.

### Q4: How is the database structured?
**A**: Three main tables with relationships:
- Students (independent)
- Courses (independent)
- Enrollments (links Students and Courses, many-to-many)

### Q5: What technologies did you use and why?
**A**:
- **Spring Boot**: Industry standard, rapid development
- **JPA/Hibernate**: Automatic table management, reduced SQL
- **Thymeleaf**: Server-side rendering, good for forms
- **Bootstrap**: Professional UI, responsive design
- **MySQL**: Reliable, widely used relational database

### Q6: Can you add authentication?
**A**: Yes, can be added using Spring Security. Would implement:
- User roles (Admin, Student)
- Login/Logout
- Role-based access control
- Session management

### Q7: How do you handle concurrent enrollments?
**A**: Database constraints (unique email) and transaction management prevent conflicts. For production, would add optimistic locking.

### Q8: Can you show the code?
**A**: Absolutely! Navigate to key files:
- `EnrollmentService.java` - Waitlist logic
- `EnrollmentController.java` - Web endpoints
- `EnrollmentRestController.java` - REST API
- `enrollment/view.html` - UI template

## Backup Demo Data

If demo goes wrong, you can quickly reset:

```sql
-- Clear all data
DELETE FROM enrollments;
DELETE FROM students;
DELETE FROM courses;

-- Re-run database-setup.sql
source database-setup.sql
```

## Time Management

**Total: 15-20 minutes**

- Introduction & Overview: 2 min
- Student Management: 3 min
- Course Management: 3 min
- Enrollment & Waitlist Demo: 7 min (FOCUS HERE)
- REST API Demo: 3 min
- Questions: 2-5 min

---

## Final Tips

1. **Practice the demo** at least twice before presentation
2. **Have sample data ready** (use database-setup.sql)
3. **Keep browser tabs open**: Home, Students, Courses, Enrollments
4. **Have Postman collection ready** for API demo
5. **Know your code**: Be ready to explain key classes
6. **Speak confidently**: You built this, you know it!

## Troubleshooting During Presentation

**If app won't start**:
- Check database is running
- Verify application.properties credentials
- Check port 8080 is free

**If database connection fails**:
- Show code and explain what it *should* do
- Have screenshots as backup

**If UI looks broken**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Clear browser cache
- Use different browser
