## Before Running the Application

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Java 21 installed: `java -version`
- [ ] MySQL/PostgreSQL installed and running
- [ ] Database created: `CREATE DATABASE course_portal_db;`
- [ ] Maven available (or use included mvnw)

### Configuration Check
- [ ] Open `src/main/resources/application.properties`
- [ ] Verify database URL is correct
- [ ] Update username if not 'root'
- [ ] Update password with your database password
- [ ] Verify port 8080 is available

### Build Verification
```bash
cd CoursePortal/CoursePortal
./mvnw clean install
```
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] All dependencies downloaded

---

## Testing Checklist

### Manual UI Testing

#### Student Management
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:8080/students/view
- [ ] Click "Add Student"
- [ ] Fill form with valid data
- [ ] Submit and verify student appears in list
- [ ] Click "Edit" on a student
- [ ] Modify details and save
- [ ] Verify changes reflected
- [ ] Click "Delete" on test student
- [ ] Confirm deletion works

#### Course Management
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:8080/courses
- [ ] Click "Add Course"
- [ ] Fill form: Name, Description, Capacity (use 3 for easy testing), Duration
- [ ] Submit and verify course appears
- [ ] Click "Edit" on the course
- [ ] Modify capacity to test
- [ ] Verify changes saved

#### Enrollment & Waitlist (CRITICAL TEST)
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:8080/enrollments/add
- [ ] Create course with capacity 3
- [ ] Enroll Student 1 → Status should be "ENROLLED"
- [ ] Enroll Student 2 → Status should be "ENROLLED"
- [ ] Enroll Student 3 → Status should be "ENROLLED"
- [ ] Enroll Student 4 → Status should be "WAITLISTED" ⭐
- [ ] Enroll Student 5 → Status should be "WAITLISTED" ⭐
- [ ] View enrollments list - verify 3 enrolled, 2 waitlisted
- [ ] Click "View Waitlist" - verify 2 students shown
- [ ] Delete one ENROLLED student
- [ ] Refresh enrollments - verify first waitlisted is now ENROLLED ⭐⭐⭐
- [ ] This proves auto-promotion works!

### API Testing

#### Using curl
```bash
# Test students endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/students

# Test courses endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/courses

# Test enrollments endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/enrollments
```
- [ ] All endpoints return JSON
- [ ] No 500 errors

#### Using test script
```bash
cd CoursePortal
chmod +x test-api.sh
./test-api.sh
```
- [ ] Script completes without errors
- [ ] All API calls succeed
- [ ] Test data created successfully

#### Using Postman (Optional)
- [ ] Import API endpoints
- [ ] Test each endpoint
- [ ] Verify responses

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Port 8080 in use
**Solution**: Change port in application.properties
```properties
server.port=8081
```

### Issue: Database connection refused
**Solution**:
1. Verify MySQL/PostgreSQL is running
2. Check credentials in application.properties
3. Ensure database exists

### Issue: Tables not created
**Solution**: Check `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` in application.properties

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution**:
```bash
./mvnw clean install -U
```

### Issue: Enrollment doesn't waitlist
**Solution**: Verify EnrollmentService logic:
- Check capacity calculation
- Ensure status assignment is correct
- Verify database has correct data
